Chapter: CLASSIFICATION
1) Binary Classification
a) Measurement

Confusion Matrix:
Compares predicted targets with actual targets and counts how often instances of class A are classified as class B, for all A/B pairs.

Precision and Recall:

Precision: Of all examples predicted as positive, how many were actually positive?

Recall: Of all actual positive examples, how many did the classifier correctly detect?

Note: High recall alone is not enough, because it ignores false positives. Catching all positives is useless if you also classify too many negatives as positives.

F1 Score:
Combines precision and recall into a single score to compare classifiers.

b) Recall/Precision Tradeoff

Classifiers often give a confidence score for each instance.

To classify an instance as positive or negative, a threshold is applied.

Raising the threshold usually increases precision but lowers recall, and lowering it increases recall but reduces precision.

You can visualize this tradeoff to choose a threshold based on your needs.

Example in Scikit-Learn:

predict(sgd_clf, X_train, y_train_5, cv=3, method="decision_function")


Note: Random Forests do not provide decision scores, but they do provide probabilities, which can be used similarly.

2) Multiclass Classification

Overview:
Multiclass classification handles more than two classes. There are two common strategies:

One-vs-Rest (OvR):

Train one classifier per class against all others.

For example, with 10 classes, train 10 binary classifiers.

The class with the highest score is chosen.

One-vs-One (OvO):

Train a classifier for each pair of classes.

For example, with 10 classes, train 45 classifiers (10 choose 2).

Measurement:

Accuracy is usually enough for multiclass classification, as it is straightforward.

Example in Scikit-Learn:

from sklearn.multiclass import OneVsRestClassifier
from sklearn.svm import SVC

ovr_clf = OneVsRestClassifier(SVC(random_state=42))
ovr_clf.fit(X_train[:2000], y_train[:2000])


Note: When training a single model, Scikit-Learn automatically chooses a strategy (OvR or OvO), but you can specify which one to use.

Tip: Go back to exercises — they are practical and help consolidate your understanding of these concepts.
